      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a rising sophomore at Brigham Young University, where I am studying
      Computer Science with an emphasis on Data Science. <br><br>
      During the school year I work as a research assistant in the 
      <a href="https://pcc.cs.byu.edu/" target=_blank> Perception, Control, Cognition</a> 
      Lab at my school. I have been researching applicatoins of the Q-learning
      Algorithm in Reinforcement learning. 
      Currently I am a Google STEP intern, which is the reason I am making this portfolio!
      <br><br>
      My favorite color is purple, my favorite food is Costco Pizza OR anything
      with avocados in it, and in my free time I like to plan international 
      trips, play video games, and read good books! <br>

            <li>Creading and Implementing Iterators in Linked Lists</li>
            <li>Using STL Stack to convert expressions from infix to 
                post/prefix and computing said expressions</li>
            <li>Creating and implementing a Deque, Queue, Stack, and Vector to 
                simulate a Roundhouse and Turntable for trains</li>
            <li>Solving a user-input 3D maze using recursion</li>
            <li>Creating a Binary Search Tree</li>
            <li>Creating an Unordered Hashmap and Ordered Set to simulate Pokemon 
                battles</li>
            <li>Using Quicksort to sort data recursively</li>
            <li>Reusing my Binary Search Tree to Create an AVL tree</li>
