      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a rising sophomore at Brigham Young University, where I am studying
      Computer Science with an emphasis on Data Science. <br><br>
      During the school year I work as a research assistant in the 
      <a href="https://pcc.cs.byu.edu/" target=_blank> Perception, Control, Cognition</a> 
      Lab at my school. I have been researching applicatoins of the Q-learning
      Algorithm in Reinforcement learning. 
      Currently I am a Google STEP intern, which is the reason I am making this portfolio!
      <br><br>
      My favorite color is purple, my favorite food is Costco Pizza OR anything
      with avocados in it, and in my free time I like to plan international 
      trips, play video games, and read good books! <br>
