      <p>This is a collection of all my STEP projects!</p>
      <p>I am a rising sophomore at Brigham Young University, where I am studying
      Computer Science with an emphasis on Data Science. <br><br>
      My favorite color is Purple, my favorite food is Costco Pizza OR anything
      with avacados in it, and in my free time I like to plan international 
      trips, play video games, and read good books! <br>
